Chocolate Lava Cakes

Here’s a simple yet delicious recipe for Chocolate Lava Cakes—rich, gooey, and sure to satisfy any chocolate craving! You only need a few ingredients and about 20 minutes.

Ingredients:
1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, plus more for greasing
1 cup (175g) semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 eggs
2 egg yolks
1/4 cup (50g) sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup (30g) all-purpose flour
Pinch of salt
Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 425°F (218°C) and grease four ramekins with butter. Place them on a baking tray.

Melt the chocolate and butter: In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate chips and butter. Microwave in 30-second bursts, stirring in between, until completely melted and smooth.

Mix the eggs and sugar: In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, and sugar until the mixture becomes slightly thick and pale.

Combine the chocolate mixture and egg mixture: Stir the melted chocolate into the egg mixture. Add vanilla extract and mix well.

Add flour and salt: Sift the flour and salt into the chocolate and egg mixture. Fold gently until the mixture is smooth.

Divide the mixture among ramekins: Pour the batter into the prepared ramekins, filling almost to the top.

Bake: Place in the oven and bake for 12-14 minutes, or until the edges look solid and firm but the center is still soft.

Serve immediately: Let them sit for about 1 minute, then cover each ramekin with an inverted plate and turn over to unmold. Serve immediately with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dusting of powdered sugar if desired.

Enjoy your indulgent treat!
