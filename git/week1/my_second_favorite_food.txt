Lemon Bars

Here's a classic and easy recipe for Lemon Bars that are delightfully tangy and sweet. They're perfect if you're looking for a refreshing dessert!

### Ingredients:
- **For the crust:**
  - 1 cup (225g) unsalted butter, softened
  - 1/2 cup (100g) sugar
  - 2 cups (240g) all-purpose flour
  - 1/4 teaspoon salt

- **For the filling:**
  - 4 large eggs
  - 1 1/2 cups (300g) sugar
  - 1/4 cup (30g) all-purpose flour
  - 2/3 cup (160ml) lemon juice (about 3-4 lemons)
  - Zest of 1 lemon

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat your oven** to 350°F (175°C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the finished bars out easily.

2. **Make the crust**:
   - In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Mix in 2 cups flour and salt until the dough comes together.
   - Press the dough into the prepared pan, building up a 1/2-inch edge on all sides. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.

3. **Prepare the filling**:
   - In another bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar. Add 1/4 cup flour, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Whisk until well combined.
   - Pour the lemon filling over the baked crust.

4. **Bake**:
   - Return the pan to the oven and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is set.
   - Let cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.

5. **Finish**:
   - Once cooled, lift the parchment paper out of the pan onto a cutting board. Cut into squares and dust with powdered sugar just before serving.

These lemon bars offer a burst of sunshine in every bite, making them a perfect treat for any occasion!
